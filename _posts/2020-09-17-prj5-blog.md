title: Visualizing Policing in Chicago
---

For my final project at Metis I set out to visualize Chicago Police Department policing in the 2019 year. I started off with two main questions; 
-How do the housing metrics of the community the crime took place in impact the odds of arrest? 
-How do the presence and quality of certain facilities (schools, grocery stores, food inspection results, pharmacies, libraries, clinics) impact the odds of arrest?

I used a logistic regression classification model to find the % impact on the odds of arrest and the statistical significance of my variables. I concluded that of the features I had selected, the community housing metrics had statistical significance with a p-value of .05, and some had large % impact as well. The half-mile radius features I had engineered had neither statistical significance nor large impact on the odds of arrest. The type of crime had inconclusive statistical significance, the model did not consider them for some reason in the p-value test- likely as the were dummied categorical variables- however they did have large % impact on the odds of arrest.

I was able to see what seemed to suggest an inverse relationship between the community arrest % and the community mortgage/foreclosure ratio.
