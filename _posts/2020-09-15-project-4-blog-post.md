title: Unsupervised Learning with Food.com Recipes
---

For the fourth project at Metis, we were tasked to use NLP (natural language processing) and any other unsupervised learning technique on a dataset. Par for the course with all of the project I did at Metis, I chose to use something I was interested in- the selection for this project was centered on food and I was quickly able to find a great [dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions) that had Food.com recipes and accompanying reviews.

This was a great dataset as it allowed me to use NLP and topic modeling on the reviews and Food.com tags, as well as clustering on the recipes that had atleast 50 reviews that eventually built into a recommender system. I was able to use a great number of NLP techniques, learning about stemming and lemmatization, topic modeling, K-means clustering with T-SNE 2D visualization, and eventually used the clustering to build a recommender system.

The code for this project can be found on my [github](https://github.com/dlsagan)
